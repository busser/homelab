# Homelab

Welcome! This repository is where I store all the resources for my homelab.

Feel free to have a look.

## Tools

The following tools are required to set up the homelab:

- [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
- [vagrant](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant)

## Getting started

Follow the instructions in the `os-image` directory to build an OS for each one
of your Raspberry Pi's and flash them onto your SD cards.

Once your Pi's have booted, they will appear on your home network. You can
connect to them with your SSH client.
